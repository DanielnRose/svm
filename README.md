# SVM 

## Project Overview
This repository contains files that explore machine learning modeling using SVM in python. This repo includes datasets, a jupyter notebook that explores SVM from the sklearn library, and a SVM presentation slide deck. 
### svm.ipynb
The jupyter notebook explores the ideas of data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and hyperparameter tuning as it relates to SVM. This can be found in the file named svm.ipynb. 
### svm.pdf
The slides are a presentation given to the data cohort regarding our findings on SVM. Some of the information contained in this document includes an overview of how SVM works, advantages and disadvantages of using SVM, preprocessing steps involved, and a dive into the hyperparameters of SVM. This can be found in the file named svm.pdf.


## Datasets Used
In this project we used a few different datasets that are all available in this repo. Firstly, we used the Cars93 dataset, which contains 93 different observations of cars. Some of the information provided about each car includes MPG (city and highway), Price, Weight, Model, Origin, etc. The data can be viewed in the Cars93.csv file. Additionally, we used the Books dataset, which contains data on 10,000 different books. This data includes things like isbn number, author, publication year, average ratings, and many more. This data can be accessed in the books.csv file. The final dataset used in this analysis was the Iris dataset. This dataset contains 193 obsercations across 3 different species of iris. This data specifically contains sepal width, sepal length, petal width, petal length, and the species. Data can be accessed at the file named Iris.csv.
